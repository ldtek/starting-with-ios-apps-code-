1. var holds data, to declare a variable var str (str is variable name) than = "whatever you want to put here"

output of code var str = "hey whats poppoin"

output: hey whats poppin 

2. output that later i guess, inside a print statment you will have the variable

output of codeL print(str)

output: hey whats poppin
